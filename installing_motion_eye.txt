When installing Buster 2021-03-04-raspios-buster-armhf.img

Placed in my raspberry pi 3, it prompted for updates, it tried to get the updates, but then it found that it could not install updates. It popped up a Window saying:

 "Repository 'http://raspbian.raspberrypi.org/raspbian buster InRelease' changed its 'Suite' value from 'stable' to 'oldstable'."


Opened another terminal window and ran:

sudo apt-get update --allow-releaseinfo-change

Went back to the "Updates" window and pressed "OK" , > "Back" to try the update again.
It was successful in updating now.
